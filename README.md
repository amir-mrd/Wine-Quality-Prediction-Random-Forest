# Wine-Quality-Prediction-Random-Forest

### Using Machine Learning model **Random Forest** to predict quality of white wines.

### Data Source:

This dataset is from the UCI machine learning repository:

https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality

To get both the dataset i.e. red and white vinho verde wine samples, from the north of Portugal, please visit the above link.

**Summary:**

In the present project, we aim to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset by investigating its distributions and interrelationships. We will identify and address any outliers, select pertinent features, and develop and assess hypotheses. Furthermore, we will explore a range of classification methodologies, culminating in the optimization of the most effective model.

Outcome: A Random Forest Classifier model that achieves 69% accuracy in predicting wine quality. With further refinements incorporating insights from wine experts, this model could potentially assist wineries or individuals in accurately assessing the quality of their wines.
